# Next-Word-Predictor

Next-Word-Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts the next word for a given sentence using the Markov Chain algorithm. This algorithm is a probabilistic model widely used in natural language processing tasks, including text generation and prediction.

## Overview

Next-Word-Predictor takes a corpus of text data as input, analyzes the frequency of word sequences, and builds a probabilistic model to predict the next word based on the preceding words in a sentence. This project aims to demonstrate the application of Markov Chain algorithm in creating a simple yet effective text prediction system.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: 
    - Clone this repository to your local machine.
    - Make sure you have Python installed.

2. **Dependencies**:
    - Next-Word-Predictor requires the following dependencies:
        - `numpy`
        - `collections`

3. **Dataset**:
    - Prepare your text corpus in a plain text file. You can use any text data suitable for your application, such as books, articles, or other sources.
    - Ensure the text file is placed in the same directory as the project files.

4. **Training**:
    - Run the `train.py` script to train the model on your dataset.
    - Example: `python train.py --corpus your_corpus.txt`

5. **Prediction**:
    - Once the model is trained, you can use the `predict.py` script to predict the next word for a given sentence.
    - Example: `python predict.py --sentence "This is"`
